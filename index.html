            <p><strong>Haven Recording was established in 2005 in Houston, TX, and relocated to Los Angeles in 2011.</strong> We are centrally located in the Los Angeles Arts District.</p>
            
            <p>Key features of the facility include a spacious Lobby with TV, Xbox, and Kitchenette. We offer spacious live and control rooms that can comfortably accommodate large groups. In addition to the main tracking room, we have a large Iso/vocal booth. The lobby is wired for sound as well, so you can utilize the unique reflective sound of the raw cedar and brick walls.</p>
            
            <p>The studio's one-of-a-kind layout and comfortable aesthetic make for an excellent environment to rehearse, write, track, or mix.</p>
